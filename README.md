## Description

Overall I enjoyed this assignment, but I also thought it was very challenging. I enjoyed being introduced to, and working with mysql for this application, and i'm excited for the future of utilizing it with more databases in the future. I also enjoyed working with and expanding my knowledge on node and and the third party package inquirer. While the transition from learning front end development to back end development has been tough, i've enjoyed all the information i've learned.
